      NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network Library (cuDNN) for aarch64.

      cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines
      such as forward and backward convolution, attention, matmul,
      pooling, and normalization.

      Installs libcudnn runtime libraries and development headers
      compatible with CUDA 12.x.
